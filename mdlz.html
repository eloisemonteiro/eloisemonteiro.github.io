                    <span class="desc">Mondelēz International is an American multinational confectionery, food, holding,
                        and beverage and snack food company right in over 150 countries around the world.
                        Inside their factories, the appeal for the commitment of employees with the quality,
                        punctuality, and teamwork need to be consistent. For that, they hired us to give them an app
                        that could bring to collaborators the feeling of belonging and be rewarded for the excellent
                        work over the months. </span>



                    <h2>Validating the problem</h2>

                    <span>They want to validate properly the effort of the Mondelēz' collaborators </span>

                        <li>They want something that attracts the eyes.</li>
                        <li>The collaborators need to choose by themselves what they want as a gift.</li>
                        <li>They need a project asap, participating though the steps and testing with real users.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Solutions</h2>

                    <h2>Graphic's Elements</h2>

                    <span>

                        I worked as a full Graphics, UI, and UX Designer for this project. Since the logo of the
                        project, the application's logo and screen's image for both stores (play and apple) to interface
                        and user test.

                        Bellow, you can see some examples, including the voucher image that would propper indicate when,
                        where, and what the collaborator would exchange his points.
                        The color pallet used was the same as Mondelēz, following their brand book and the typography
                        used in the project.

                    </span>

                    <h2>Lo-Fi Wireframe</h2>

                    <span>

                        The lo-fi wireframe in this project was very important since working in an Agile methodology we
                        need the things working as they should during the development, with sprints of one week we
                        couldn't afford to have the wrong information on the interface to conduct the user tests at the
                        end.

                    </span>

                    <span class="text-center"><img src="img/mdlz_wire.png" class="project margin-bottom"

                    <h2>Visual Design</h2>

                    <span>
                        To this project, we focused on the main elements that bright the Mondelēz' purple signature. I
                        wanted to highlight the colors and the fun environment of this application's purpose.
